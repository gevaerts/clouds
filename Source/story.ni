Section 2 -- Game things

mountain golf is a scene. [This should be recurring, but there's a bug...]
mountain golf begins when Jacques is in cloud nine or Joseph is in cloud nine or the player is in tee-ten.

mountain golf ends when all golf balls are not in play and the golf ball owned by the player has been in play.

mountain tops are scenery in cloud nine. "Those are mountain tops. Some of them are nice and green.".
neatly trimmed grass is scenery in cloud nine. "This grass is very well maintained. You wonder if there's a reason for that.".
hilltops are scenery in cloud nine. "You can see flags on them".
a hilltop is  scenery in cloud nine. "You can see a flag on it".
[todo: this scenery isn't ready yet. It needs lots of Understand clauses]

When mountain golf begins:
	say "The weather clears a bit, and you can now see that the white fluffy things were all actually grass-covered [mountain tops].";
	Now the romantic interest owns the fourth golf ball;
	if the romantic interest is following:
		Now the romantic interest is stationary;
	repeat with the distributed ball running through all golf balls:
		now the owner of the distributed ball holds the distributed ball;
	Now the description of cloud nine is "The area around you is covered in [neatly trimmed grass]. You can see a path leading to a hilltop in the east, and a similar one the northwest. The hilltops seem to have flags on them. Maybe you should look at them more closely.";
	Now the printed name of cloud nine is "A  neatly trimmed lawn";
	change the northwest exit of Cloud Nine to tee-ten;
	change the southeast exit of tee-ten to Cloud Nine;



After printing the description of cloud nine during mountain golf:
	say "You can see a path leading to the northwest."

Check an actor going during mountain golf:

		say "A golf ball just landed near you.";
		
Every turn during mountain golf:
	repeat with the golfer running through all people in a golf_course:
		if the golfer is not the player:
			if the golfer is in tee-ten and the golfer is holding a golf ball (called the actual ball):
				try the golfer dropping the actual ball;
